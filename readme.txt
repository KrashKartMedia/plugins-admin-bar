Plugins Admin Bar is a free WordPress Plugin that adds a link to the WordPress Admin Bar, under the site name menu.

== Description ==

Plugins are amazing tools in the WordPress ecosystem. Every WordPress site has at least one plugins installed/activated. Yet there is no quick link to installed plugins. Plugins Admin Bar fixes this.

WordPress has the WP Admin Bar at the top of every site. On the front end of the site, you'll see the name of your site as a link to /wp-admin/. Under the Site Name, there is a sub-menu with quick links to the Dashboard, Themes, Widgets, and Menus.


Plugin Admin Bar adds a new menu item to the quick links sub-menu, called Plugins, for a single site install. 
The new menu item has it's own sub menu with quick links to Add a new plugin, add new popular plugin, add new recommended plugin, add new favorite plugin, view active plugins, and view inactive plugins.

Plugin Admin Bar adds two new menu item to the quick links sub-menu, called Plugins and Network Plugins, for a multisite install. The two new menu items have their own sub menu items with quick links to Add a new network plugin, add new popular plugin, add new recommended plugin, add new favorite plugin, view network active plugins, and view network inactive plugins, and view network must use plugins. You can also view plugins active or inactive for a single site.

See screenshots for more information.

With Plugins Admin Bar, you'll never have to click 4 or 5 times just to install a new plugin, ever again.
