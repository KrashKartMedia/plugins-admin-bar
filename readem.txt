Plugins Admin Bar is a free WordPress Plugin that adds a link to the WordPress Admin Bar, under the site name.

== Description ==

Plugins are amazing tools in the WordPress Ecosystem. Every WordPress site has at least one plugins installed/activated. Yet there is no quick link to installed plugins. Plugins Admin Bar fixes this.

WordPress has the WP Admin Bar at the top of every site. On the front end of the site, you'll see the name of your site as a link to /wp-admin/. Under the Site Name, there is a sub-menu with quick links to the Dashboard, Themes, Widgets, and Menus. Plugin Admin Bar adds a new menu item to the quick links sub-menu, called Plugins. The new menu item has it's own sub menu with quick links to Add a new plugin, active plugins, inactive plugins, and the plugin editor.
                      
== Frequently Asked Questions ==

The post types we do know about, in popular themes and plugins, will be listed as Regular CPT, Hidden CPT, WordPress Core - Regular CPT, WordPress Core - Hidden CPT, Regular CPT, Hidden CPT, WooCommerce Core Regular CPT, WooCommerce Core Hidden CPT. Everything else will be called Other.

A definition is provided in the sidebar of the plugin settings page.

= What are post type definitions? =

We have set up a check to determine if a post type is public facing, hidden or some type of other custom post type. This is to make it easier for the end user to understand why a custom post type might be hidden from the WordPress Navigation Menu.
